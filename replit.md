Query Builder Application
Overview
This is a modern SQL query builder application built with Angular, TypeScript, and Node.js. The application provides a visual interface for constructing SQL queries through a drag-and-drop interface, with AI-powered natural language query generation capabilities. It features a clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS and Angular's standalone components.
